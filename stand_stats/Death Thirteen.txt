Death Thirteen is unique in that it can only exist inside a dream world and thus requires that its victims are asleep.
When a living being falls asleep near Death Thirteen's User, they are drawn into Death Thirteen's dream world, which appears as a massive carnival, complete with Ferris wheels and roller coasters. Death Thirteen has full control over this dream world. Stand Users cannot summon their Stand inside the dream world; however, someone who falls asleep (or unconscious) with their Stand active will be able to summon the Stand inside the dream world. No one can willingly wake up from the dream world, but can be woken up by someone or something else. Upon waking, any victim who didn't bring their Stand into the dream world will forget the dream, but will remember the dread they felt. Injuries dealt to people in the dream world, and wounds healed in the dream world, are transfered to the real-life bodies.
Death Thirteen uses a scythe to attack victims.
