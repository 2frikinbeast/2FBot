The Fool manifests itself as a pile of sand that Iggy manipulates. Despite its straightforward nature, The Fool is remarkably powerful. Iggy is free to manipulate the sand as he sees fit, even being able to control the physical properties of the sand to an extent. As The Fool is only bound to the sand it manipulates, it cannot be harmed in any way (attacking it would just mean attacking a pile of sand), and as such, Iggy cannot and will not be harmed if the Stand is attacked.
The Fool is able to take the shape of anything Iggy wants, from living people to useful objects.
