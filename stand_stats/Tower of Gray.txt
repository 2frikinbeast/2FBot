Tower of Gray is a small and fragile Stand. It is also incredibly fast and nimble, and is capable of flight.
Its defining feature is its long, extendable stinger, referred to as the "Tower Needle", which protrudes from its mouth. It has enough force to tear or pierce flesh.
Tower of Gray has great flight control; however, it cannot dodge something it doesn't see coming, and is vulnerable to sneak attacks.
