Sheer Heart Attack is Killer Queen's secondary bomb; it is a heat-seeking automatic bomb that detaches from Killer Queen's left hand. Thusly, any damage inflicted to Sheer Heart Attack is inflicted to Kira's left hand. (Cutting off Kira's left hand does not deactivate the Stand.)
The body of Sheer Heart Attack is nigh-indestructible to physical damage. It is completely autonomous and has a great range. It seeks out whatever the warmest object in the vicinity is, even changing targets the second a warmer object appears; upon reaching its target, it automatically induces an explosion with power and blast size equivalent to the heat of the target. Like Killer Queen's primary bomb, Sheer Heart Attack's explosions remove all physical evidence of the target.
Its primary weakness is its autonomy. Kira cannot specify a target, and must physically retrive Sheer Heart Attack after he is done.
