Sun's foremost power is to emit light and heat at lethal levels over a large area. Not only does Sun shine bright enough to give the impression of being in the middle of a bright day despite the time showing that it's nighttime, it also raises the surrounding temperatures up to 80 degrees C (176 degrees F). Moreover, it can maintain that level of power over a long period. The user is also affected by the Stand's heat.
In addition to its radiating of heat, Sun is also able to shoot "light ray energy"[1] capable of inflicting significant damage. When threatened, it will shoot rays in all directions but can also strike with precision.
