Star Platinum has an overwhelming physical prowess in every basic characteristic, save for range. In addition, Jotaro's eventual discovery of its true potential only makes it all the more formidable in combat; the technique is referred to by Jotaro as Star Platinum: The World. When activated, Star Platinum is able to halt the flow of time for a brief moment, causing everything around him to appear frozen in place. During this time-lapse, Jotaro is able to interact with any object or person within his range. Measures of time during Time Stop correspond to normal measures. He is unable to use the ability consecutively, requiring a few seconds in between each usage.
