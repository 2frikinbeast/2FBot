Killer Queen is a short-range humanoid Stand of average to above-average speed and melee attacking power.
Killer Queen's powers revolve around setting up different kinds of bombs that can annihilate Kira's enemies in one blast. In addition to Sheer Heart Attack and ||Bites the Dust||, Killer Queen may charge any object, inanimate or not, as a bomb simply by touching it. Once a target has touched the object, Killer Queen can detonate the target by pressing its right thumb onto its index finger's middle phalanx, as if pressing a trigger on a handheld detonator; the charge immediately travels through the target's body before exploding. Additionally, Killer Queen can blow up the charged target itself; however, if someone else touches the charged target before Kira can detonate it, they will automatically be blown up instead, consuming the charge.
