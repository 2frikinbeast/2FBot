Hierophant Green is relatively weak in direct hand-to-hand combat, as a trade-off for its great distance-based abilities. It is not humanoid, but instead just a group of connected membranes; it is able to unravel itself into multiple long strings.
Hierophant Green is capable of sliding its coils into a person's body, allowing Kakyoin complete control of that person. This serves to protect Hierophant Green and Kakyoin from attacks if his opponent is someone unwilling to harm the innocent. Additionally, he can completely destroy the controlled being's air passage as he emerges, as well as the host's internal organs.
Emerald Splash is Hierophant Green's most powerful ability. It gathers energy into its body, before firing off a large amount of energy which takes the form of emeralds. The blast's range and shotgun-like dispersion, along with its incredible destructive power and high speed, make Hierophant Green an extremely capable combatant.
