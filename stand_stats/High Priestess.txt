High Priestess's small size and nimbleness make it difficult to strike. Its claws are very dangerous, being able to slice through metal. High Priestess possesses teeth harder than diamonds, making them almost unbreakable. Moreover, because it is a long-range Stand, Midler can sit away from danger while she commands High Priestess. On the other hand, it also means that Midler can be taken out through defeating High Priestess.
High Priestess possesses the ability to shapeshift and assimilate itself into any type of inorganic matter, be it metal, glass or plastic. The transformation is convincing enough that cautious examination or even trying to touch it will fool anyone. Because of that, it can disappear into a wall and then reappear elsewhere to strike. High Priestess can also grow in size by assimilating a great amount of inorganic material.
