Kiss is able to place lip-designed stickers on objects, causing them to rapidly produce an exact copy of the original.
Ermes and Kiss are able to create distinctive square stickers out of their palms. If they put a sticker on an object, an exact copy of it emerges with the sticker either remaining on the copy or the original. There is no restriction on how far the copy can be taken away from the object. If Ermes places a sticker on someone, the corresponding limb, be it a finger, an arm or the head, will sprout out of the body like an additional body part. She is also free to use it on herself.
When the sticker is removed or destroyed, the two objects spring toward each other and fuse back into one object with great force, causing a fissure and effectively damaging it.
