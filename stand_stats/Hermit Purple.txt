Hermit Purple's vines are relatively weak in combat, but they provide Joseph with considerable divination ability, enabling him to materialize any type of information, such as an image, a location or even thoughts.
Joseph can use the vines as ropes, whose movements he can control at will. Their length and resistance make it possible for Joseph to swing from place to place and tie someone.
Joseph can transmit Hamon through Hermit Purple as an extension of his body.
