Geb
**User:** N'Doul
**Name reference:** Geb (Egyptian deity)
**Destructive Power:** C
**Speed:** B
**Range:** A
**Persistence:** B
**Precision:** D
**Development Potential:** D
Geb's greatest strength is the range at which it can be controlled precisely, enabling N'Doul to sit kilometers away from his target. Combined with N'Doul's ability to sense vibrations from faraway, Geb can reliably act while its user is safe.
Geb, being a body of water, is completely amorphous and hence is exceptionally flexible and nimble. Despite being a mass of water, Geb's claw is strong enough to cut flesh or metal. In addition, the water can act as a hard shield against projectiles. However, Geb's water is vulnerable to extreme heat; Geb evaporating can damage N'Doul.
