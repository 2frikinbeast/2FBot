Ebony Devil
**User:** Devo
**Name reference:** The Devil (tarot card)
**Destructive Power:** D
**Speed:** D
**Range:** A
**Persistence:** B
**Precision:** D
**Development Potential:** B
Ebony Devil's power activates once Devo is hit by his foe. It then grows more powerful depending on the hatred Devo feels towards his enemy relative to the amount of damage he's received.
Ebony Devil can then transfer itself to something physical in order to attack, preferably a doll. It will begin to attack its foe, starting quietly and escaping its opponent's notice, before causing more and more misfortune as necessary. Devo can control the doll from a distance and can see through its eyes. Any damage inflicted to the possessed object is reflected on Devo.
