Soft & Wet generates star-embedded floating bubbles, which must make contact with its target to work effectively. However, Josuke can control where the bubbles can fly, allowing him to send them where they are needed. The bubbles are actually comprised of tiny cords vibrating at super-high speeds, giving them the appearance of spheres. These bubbles are able to pop with enough force to cause damage at close range. ||It is eventually revealed that his soap bubbles are actually soft lines that spin rapidly, which is described as part of the Spin.||
Soft & Wet's signature ability is to "steal something from [an object] and take it for itself", which works in conjunction with the bubbles. Josuke can thus steal aspects or properties of inanimate and living things. Said properties seem to also be smaller objects that come from a bigger object. Soft & Wet can also transfer stolen properties to other objects.
