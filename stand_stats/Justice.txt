Justice's foremost power allows it to control the bodies of others through an open wound. When someone is wounded on any part of their body, the victim's flowing blood will be absorbed into the fog and Justice then creates a perfectly clean, round hole on the victim which can pierce through a sufficiently thin body part like the wrist or the tongue. Justice then sends a string of fog into the hole like thread tied to a puppet and takes control of the associated body part like a puppeteer. Enya can then make the controlled parts move as she wishes. Justice's puppetry power is so powerful it can take control of dozens of corpses and manipulate them with precision, which can result in a large band of puppets under the control of Justice. Despite being mere skeletons, the puppets appear as normal humans, though with deformed features and holes all over their body.
Justice can manifest incredibly realistic and detailed illusions anywhere within its range.
