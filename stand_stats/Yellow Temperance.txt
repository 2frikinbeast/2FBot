Yellow Temperance's primary power is the ability to assimilate organic matter, using it to grow stronger and larger. Thus, its user constantly seeks things to consume even when hidden. It also makes it visible to ordinary people. When deposited as just a small part on someone else, Yellow Temperance begins to cover their entire body, spreading to wherever it has touched until it completely assimilates the victim, killing them.
Yellow Temperance is able to alter Rubber Soul's physical appearance. Rubber Soul has been shown to mimic people and Stands.
Yellow Temperance, because of its blob-like nature, has the capacity to absorb obscene amounts of physical punishment and impacts, acting as an armor for Rubber Soul. It can resist impacts, burning, and freezing. It also seems to protect its user underneath from any damage as well. It cannot, however, make up for human frailties, such as the need for oxygen.
