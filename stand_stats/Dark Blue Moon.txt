Dark Blue Moon is a marine Stand, and, as such, its skills are more effective in an aquatic environment.
By itself, Dark Blue Moon is a powerful Stand whose physical abilities are greater than average. Dark Blue Moon's claws are strong and sharp enough to destroy a still-running propeller and slice a shark in two with ease. Moreover, it can create strong whirlpools by simply spinning its webbed hands or feet fast enough.
Dark Blue Moon can also use its scales as razor-sharp projectiles, throwing them against the enemy.
Dark Blue Moon is capable of creating acorn barnacles. These barnacles drain the target of its strength and also allow Dark Blue Moon slight control over the infected body parts, allowing it to drag its foes back into the water if they try to escape.
