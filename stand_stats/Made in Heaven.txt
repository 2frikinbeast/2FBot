This Stand is the final metamorphosis in a chain following Whitesnake and C-Moon; it's considered by DIO to be the ultimate Stand and the key to achieving "heaven".
Made in Heaven's power is to dramatically speed up the flow of time, achieved via its ability to control the gravitational forces of the Earth, moon, and the universe itself. Time will gradually flow faster and faster across the universe. Made in Heaven prevents any living being, excluding Pucci and God, from catching up with the acceleration.
Pucci himself possesses extraordinary speed and reaction time.
||As time continues to accelerate, the universe will hit a "vanishing point", and a new universe will be created, where everything repeats itself. Anyone that has recently died in the previous universe will be replaced by a similar substitute.||
