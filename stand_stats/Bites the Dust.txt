Bites the Dust is Killer Queen's tertiary bomb. This ability was granted to Kira after being pierced by the Stand Arrow a second time, and was born from Kira's desire to keep his identity a secret.
When activated, Killer Queen is separated from Kira and planted into a host; it acts independently of Kira's will, manifesting only when the bomb is triggered. Killer Queen protects the host at all costs. If the host discloses Kira's identity, Killer Queen explodes the learner of Kira's identity, then rewinds time roughly 1 hour. These actions become "fated" and will become destined to happen over and over. Only the host retains their pre-rewind memories. The only way to stop Bites the Dust is to kill Kira or force him to withdraw it.
