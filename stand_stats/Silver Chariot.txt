Silver Chariot is a powerful, battle-dedicated close-range Stand that primarily fights with the rapier it is equipped with. It is an incredibly agile Stand, able to attack enemies before the opponent can react. It can also use this agility to defend and deflect attacks aimed at it or its user.
Silver Chariot is unable to see whatever its user cannot see, making it weak if Polnareff is in any way in a blind spot.
Its armor lowers its speed, but also prevents it from being injured, as Polnareff does not receive the same injuries that the armor does as long as it's donned. Polnareff is able to shed Silver Chariot's armor in order to gain tremendous speed (enough for afterimages to appear), but doing so renders his Stand more vulnerable to attack.
Silver Chariot's only ranged ability launches its sword with great force and precision. However, Silver Chariot can only materialize one sword, so Polnareff must retrive the sword before being able to attack again.
