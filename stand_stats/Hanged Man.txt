Hanged Man is a Stand that attacks via reflections, and is visible only in the reflection. Rather than attacking a person directly, it will appear in a reflective surface (including, but not limited to, glass, coins, and human eyes) and attack their reflection. The victim will then bear the results of the attack.
Hanged Man can only move between reflective surfaces in a linear pattern and is forced to move to another reflection in front of it if its current location stops reflecting. Hanged Man is vulnerable while in transit between surfaces, and while it does transit quickly, a quick-enough Stand can still hit it, damaging it and its User. This is helped by forcing Hanged Man into a predictable path of transit.
Hanged Man, like J. Geil, has two right hands. Hanged Man's hands can produce thin knives from its wrists, easily capable of cutting flesh.
