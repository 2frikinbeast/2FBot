Boku no Rhythm wo Kiitekure has the ability to insert small bombs into practically anything Oyecomova touches. The bombs take the form of small pins topped with clocks that affix themselves to any surface, not just solid matter. It's been shown that the pins can be placed on almost anything, including Oyecomova's skin, other people, water, animals, dirt, and even cigarette smoke.
After a while, the highly-sensitive pins are set off when they spring into the air and explode with great force. The only way to stop the bombs is to stop them from springing. However, even if the pins were to be held down by hand, which would severely hamper the fighting ability of most, intense sweating from combat would cause them to ultimately slip loose. The Stand can place as many pins as it wants. The bombs also make its user essentially untouchable, as grabbing him or striking him would riddle the attacker with pins.
