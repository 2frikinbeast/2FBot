The World is an exceptionally powerful Close-Range Stand much like Star Platinum, but boasting an effective range of approximately 10 meters.
The World's signature power is its ability to stop time, allowing only itself, DIO and anyone with the same power, to act within the duration of stopped time. In the stopped time, DIO can move his own body freely along with any object he touches that he wishes to move. All force applied by DIO during stopped time continues to exist after the time stop; objects that DIO throws can momentarily move during the stopped time before grinding to a halt. No forces other than the time stopper's exist in stopped time, therefore DIO can seemingly levitate in stopped time because there is no gravity.
The duration of time stop increased as DIO became more accustomed to The World. Towards the end of *Stardust Crusaders*, DIO had become accustomed enough to stop time for up to 9 seconds.
