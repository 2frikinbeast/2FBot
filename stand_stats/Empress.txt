Empress is a hybrid between flesh and Stand that is both dangerous and frustrating to get rid of if planted on its victim. Empress must first be planted into another person through direct contact with Nena's blood, but can otherwise be controlled by her remotely. The zone splattered with blood will develop a fleshy bud, similar in appearance to a wart. Empress will then slowly and continuously grow out of the victim's flesh as long as it feeds off exterior sources relative to it's size, be it small insects, fruits or whole chickens. Empress will eventually reach a humanoid form and will constantly try to hinder, harm, or kill its host. Empress is a mix of the victim's flesh and a Stand and takes properties from both. Thus, it can be heard by someone but will be seen as a mere wart by ordinary people, and only a Stand can harm it,
