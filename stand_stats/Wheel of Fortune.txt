The Stand's primary ability dramatically enhances a vehicle's appearance and capabilities, "allowing even a common dilapidated car to transform into a more powerful car with (nigh-permanent) four-wheel drive." The car is also able to repair itself, distort its hull to squeeze inside a crevice, orientate its wheels horizontally to drive between walls, create spikes on the wheels to scale a cliff, and even separate its internal wiring to create dangerous sparks. The shapeshifting is linked to ZZ's confidence: the more aggressive he is, the more powerful and monstrous the car will be. Conversely, when he begs for his life, the car reverts to its true state.
Wheel of Fortune can shoot its own gasoline at its opponents as a high pressure scatter shot. The gasoline is fired with enough force to damage a human body, but its primary purpose is to make its targets highly flammable, allowing ZZ to set them ablaze with sparks from his car's cables.
ZZ can hijack nearby cars' radios in order to converse with people.
