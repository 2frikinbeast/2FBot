Emperor manifests as a gun that Hol Horse can directly summon to his hand. The characteristic ability of Emperor, and its most dangerous, is its ability to freely control the trajectory of its bullets with incredible speed and precision. However, because the bullets are still part of Emperor, they are subject to Emperor's limited range. Emperor's effectiveness drops rapidly as the bullets reach the limits of its range.
