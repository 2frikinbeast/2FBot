Judgement is a fairly powerful Stand, having above average strength and speed as far as Stands go. Its large metal body is particularly hard to damage.
Judgement's unique power is to create clay constructs out of humans' deepest desires, but it will turn the wishes against its victims. This is a representation of Judgement's power; to toy with a person's heart. The fakes are nearly perfect: fake treasures will have the weight and texture of real gold and fake people will have the appearance (although Judgement purposefully makes them more monstrous), voice and memories of the real person.
