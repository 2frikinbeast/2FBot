Magician's Red is a physically powerful Close-Range Stand.
Magician's Red's signature ability is to freely generate and control fire. The resulting flames are intense enough to evaporate metal projectiles mid-air and slice railroad tracks. Moreover, Magician's Red's flames are not ordinary flames, but can be freely manipulated by Avdol. With a thought, the fortuneteller can redirect his flames mid-air, give them any shape, control how intense their destructive power is, and even give them other supernatural properties. As the flames are the product of a Stand, they are invisible to non-Stand users despite still having the same properties as normal flames; non-Stand users merely feel the heat and see the generated heat waves.
Avdol prefers open spaces in order to bring out the true power of Magician's Red.
