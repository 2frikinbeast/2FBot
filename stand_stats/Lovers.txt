Lovers's primary ability is to enter the brain of its victim, more precisely the brain stem, and manipulate their pain receptors. When Steely Dan feels any physical stimuli, be it the pain from a punch, or even the sensation of cracking his fingers, Lovers will go berserk inside the brain and return the pain several folds to its victim, causing them to be in agony. It can even cause phantom pain in absent limbs.
Lovers can take brain cells and turn them into mash for various uses. First, it can disguise itself as another Stand using the mash to cover itself but can also create a myriad of dummies that aren't the real Stand but can still harm a Stand that has been shrunk to its size.
